#  Tweets

## Installation

In order to work, you will need to create an application on the [Twitter Dev Platform](https://apps.twitter.com/).
Once you've clone the repository, you'll need to add a Configurations.swift into Tweets group.
In this configuration file, create two constants with your application configurations:

```
let CONSUMER_KEY="YOUR_KEY_HERE"
let CONSUMER_SECRET="YOUR_SECRET_HERE"
```
